# Bootable Kernel Development Plan

## Current Status: Analysis Phase
- [ ] Analyze existing project structure and implementation
- [ ] Review build system (Makefile)
- [ ] Check kernel entry point and boot sequence
- [ ] Verify memory management implementation
- [ ] Test compilation process

## Core Boot Requirements
- [ ] Ensure bootloader is properly configured
- [ ] Verify kernel entry point works correctly
- [ ] Test basic kernel initialization
- [ ] Validate memory management and paging setup

## Build System
- [ ] Fix any compilation issues
- [ ] Create proper kernel image output
- [ ] Set up GRUB configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper linking of kernel sections

## VM Testing
- [ ] Create bootable ISO or disk image
- [ ] Test in QEMU/KVM
- [ ] Debug any boot failures
- [ ] Verify kernel runs and responds

## Final Verification
- [ ] Confirm successful boot in VM
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Document any remaining issues
